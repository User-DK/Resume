\runsubsection{Pyseldonlib for Opinion Dynamics Simulation}
\location{}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Developed a Python package for simulating opinion dynamics, leveraging \textbf{Pybind11} to bind C++ code to Python.
\item Tackled the challenge of working with \textbf{templated classes} in C++ to ensure correct usage and seamless integration in Python.
\item Applied \textbf{Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)} principles and modular programming to design Python model classes and a network class, providing a clean API for interacting with simulation networks.
\item Authored comprehensive documentation, including detailed visualizations for the \textbf{Classical DeGroot Model} to enhance understanding of opinion dynamics.
\item Implemented a \textbf{CI/CD pipeline} for generating Python wheels for multiple platforms, including \textbf{Linux}, \textbf{macOS}, and \textbf{Windows}.
\item Technologies used: \textbf{C++}, \textbf{Python}, \textbf{Pybind11}, \textbf{Sphinx} (for documentation), \textbf{Meson} (for build automation), \textbf{Micromamba} (for environment management), \textbf{GitHub Actions} (for CI), \textbf{Cytoscape} (for Network Simulation).
